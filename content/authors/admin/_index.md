I am an associate professor at [Ted Rogers School of Information Technology Management (TRSITM)](https://www.ryerson.ca/information-technology-management/) at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/) and an adjunct professor in the department of [Management Sciences](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

Prior to joining TRSITM, I held a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in the [Faculty of Information (iSchool)](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I received my PhD from [York University](http://dminer.eecs.yorku.ca/), where my research focused on developing scalable frameworks to extract actionable knowledge from big data streams and graph data.
